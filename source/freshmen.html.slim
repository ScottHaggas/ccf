p Hello and welcome to CCF. Again, congratulations on getting in to GT. Thatâ€™s a huge deal. GT is great, and hard, but worth it. The most important thing is finding a community of people that you get along with and that love you just the way you are. Some of the current freshmen have answered some common questions that you might have as you prepare to come to Tech.
p Enjoy, and feel free to facebook us if you have any more questions!
