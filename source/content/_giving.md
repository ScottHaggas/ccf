#Thank you
Thank you for clicking on the “Giving to CCF” tab on our webpage. To share a little more about GTCCF, we are fully funded by donations and a 501 c (3) non-profit organization so all your gifts are tax deductible! Each gift goes towards impacting a student’s life for Jesus Christ.

Our greatest need is monthly operational giving. Our operational budget funds all the free meals, programs, events, staffing, the campus and everything else needed to fulfill our mission.

Please join us in prayer and financial support!

Below is a breakdown demonstrating how every dollar no matter the amount can directly impact a student:

* $25 a month – small group & bible study materials
* $50 a month – fresh baked cinnamon rolls
* $75 a month – Café Desserts for a week
* $200 a month – Trivia Lunch for a week
* $400 a month – Feeding Frenzy for a week
* $300 a month – An intern for a month

Please contact Ashley (Hightower) Teffeau with any questions concerning giving at ashleyccf@gmail.com.

*One–Time Gifts and Gifts-In-Kind* are also needed to help GTCCF reach out to students. Please see below some various current one time needs or contact Ashley with any additional needs.

*Stock Gifts* – are also accepted and sold immediately after the transfer is made. By selling the stocks it allows the donor to donate the amount they intended to and will go directly to the ministry for use.

To give to GTCCF we have various methods of payment: autodraft, PayPal, and checks.

*Auto Draft Form* – [Download](http://gtccf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CCF-Autodraft-Form-Operational.doc) the form to begin autodraft. It is our most common giving method for monthly givers.

#Feed a Hungry College Student

##Feeding Frenzy
Every Thursday night before Bible Study, GT CCF offers its students a free dinner called “Feeding Frenzy” beginning at 6:30pm. About 400 students normally attend Feeding Frenzy. Your group can bring food that is already prepared (fast food, barbeque, sub sandwiches, etc.) or use our kitchen to cook dinner here. Student favorites include lasagna, burritos, barbeque sandwiches, and grilled cheese sandwiches and soup. You can sponsor a Feeding Frenzy by either providing food or providing a donation of $400.00.

##Devo Lunch
Each Monday, students gather for devotional lunch, or “devo” lunch, which includes a free lunch and a short. We offer two sessions of devo lunch at 11am and 12pm every Monday. About 200 students (an average of 100 students per session) attend devo lunch each week. This is especially effective in allowing students to invite their friends from class to come by CCF for a free lunch. You can sponsor both lunches ($400), one lunch ($200), or partially support a devo lunch.

##Tailgate Party
On Georgia Tech home football game days, GT CCF hosts tailgate parties for students, their friends, and alumni who are on campus for the game. About 200 people usually stop by the house before heading to the game. We grill hot dogs and hamburgers outside and set up the big screen projection TV inside the house so people can watch the pregame show. It’s a great way to get fans pumped up to cheer on the Yellow Jackets and an easy way for CCFers to introduce their friends to CCF. You can sponsor a Tailgate Party for $250.00.

##Adopt-A-Van

GTCCF attends seven retreats every school year, one of which is held at Panama City Beach, Florida. For this retreat, we rent 15 person passenger vans to ensure safe travel for our staff and students. CCF subsidizes the cost of the vans to make the retreats affordable to students, so this is a definite need in order to make these trips feasible. The vans cost $500 each for three days, and we usually rent 15-18 vans per retreat. You may also choose to “purchase” a van for the retreat for $500.00, a bench for $125.00, or a seat for $50.00.
